### How to get Started
* First, write our code to connect to Insomnia and MongoDb
* Create our Schemas for characters, houses, and spells
* Create the controllers for each Schema
* Plan out the routes that connect with the controller
* Make the front end with a nav bar so user can go between the tabs of Characters and Spells.
* Link the backend to our frontend so we can display our information.
* Style it up!
